📝 Easy Explanation
🔹 try
Code that may cause an exception
🔹 catch
Handles specific exception
🔹 finally
Always executes regardless of exception
Useful for closing resources (e.g., Scanner, file, database connection)
🔑 One-Line Exam Answer
The finally block executes always, even if an exception occurs or is handled, ensuring cleanup or final statements run.
